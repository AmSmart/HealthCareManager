# HealthCareManager

This web application was built for an IOT project.  This project aim was to develop a multifaceted WEB application that will aid in the traceability of mixed intravenous medications from beginning to end of the prescription–validation–dosing–preparation–administration (PVD-PA) process
and will be accessible to all health professionals involved, including doctors, pharmacists, and nursing staff from the hospital pharmacy and day hospital.
